# EscapeFromMonkeyLab
## Get a deceptive monkey outside of an evil lab (Nordic Game Jam 2010)

This game has been developed during the Nordic Game Jam 2010 by Jurgo Boemo, Paolo Burelli, Stefano Driussi, John Julian Hansen, Alessandro Mulloni, Jonas Rasmussen and Francesco Zanitti.
The theme of the jam was deception so we made a game based on visual deception, the entire game has been developed in 48 hours using Unity, and all the assets have been produced by us.
